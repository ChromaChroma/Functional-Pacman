# haskell-game
Game coded in Haskell made for a project of the Utrecht University. 
[Github Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects) is used during the development of this project to keep an overview on the progression and backlog of the project.

## Setup
To get the application running with the Gloss library on windows, the freeglut.dll is added to the project root to be able to execute `cabal run`
for us (me, Jona), a small fix was needed with GLUT. 
Here [stack overflow page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8956387/cant-get-freeglut-to-work-with-haskell-on-windows) explaining a 'hack' to use it globally on windows.
